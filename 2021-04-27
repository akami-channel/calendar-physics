I've started to go through these 2 textbooks, one on GR (General Relativity; it's a classic and iconic textbook), the other on abstract algebra (group theory):

Gravitation

Algebra
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134689607

I just now purchased 3 books on linear algebra (I might be acquainted well enough with it, but I want to be really good at it):

No bullshit guide to linear algebra:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0992001021

Dover books Linear Algebra book (I think this publisher is only good for reviewing stuff after you already know it)
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/048663518X

And I got "Linear Algebra Done Right".

And this one:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/9083136604

Other books I might want to get in the future (they are more expensive and 4 is enough already for now):
