In this video, Susskind starts with the basics of QFT and uses it to derive the Shrodinger equation.

This playlist is great for learning about tensors.

Is magnetism an illusion that can be explained by length contraction in special relativity?

This video relates to the Clifford torus. Likely beyond my current level:

This lecture by Edward Witten is well beyond my current level, but it helps make me curious about a lot of things (I want to learn about the symmetries (group theory) of the standard model):

Does the Feynman path integral formulation complement QFT, or is QFT a better version? Not sure, but here are a few videos from PBS:

Bell's Inequality: (PBS)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tafGL02EUOA

I am curious if Bohmian QM (pilot wave theory) can really explain Bell's Inequality, entanglement, and the Delayed Quantum Eraser Experiment. Perhaps yes, perhaps not (imo). I need to dig deeper.

This is the youtube channel, THE YouTube channel that really addresses the relationship of symmetries of quaternions and octonions and the standard model. Definitely something I am very curious about, but I need to improve my understanding of group theory and the standard model by a lot before understanding the videos in this channel. Kudos to Cohl Furey.

Group Theory in a nutshell for physicists. Well over my head. I ordered his book.

The (production) quality of these videos did not strike me as good, but I did check them out (trying to learn symmetries in group theory and physics):

Good for polarity of photons (light can have circular polarity; I was under the misconception before that the E and M fields of photons go to zero together, but I believe in fact these can have different phases)
